## Research Themes

We explore the frontiers of geospatial science and engineering to address the pressing challenges in urban sustainability and climate resilience. Our current research themes include:

- **GeoAI for Urban Mapping**: Developing deep learning and machine learning algorithms for remote sensing and photogrammetry tasks, such as semantic segmentation, change detection, and digital twin modeling.

- **Urban Climate and Green Infrastructure**: Investigating the spatial patterns of heat, albedo, and vegetation in cities using high-resolution spatial data (e.g., LiDAR, multispectral imagery) to inform heat resilience strategies.

- **Walkability and Soft Accessibility**: Quantifying pedestrian route quality and accessibility using 3D geospatial data, including LiDAR and street view imagery, to promote equitable infrastructure planning.

- **Data-Driven Decision Support**: Creating actionable insights and tools to support urban planners and policymakers through spatial modeling and scenario simulation.
